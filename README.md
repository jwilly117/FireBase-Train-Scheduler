# Train Scheduler Using Firebase


### Summary
Train Scheduler is a table based scheduling tool used to demonstrate the use of firebase as a database structure. 

### The goal of this project
The goals is simply to make a list based application a user can add items to, in this case trains. Then the data in sent to and stored in a firebase table and pulled onto a styled table on the site that includes all previous entries. 

### File Structure
At the time of this writing, all of the data is stored in one firebase table. As for the site, it is simply a one page html and CSS site with some in-line Javascript to interact with the firebase table. 

### Instructions
Upon loading the page, the user will be shown a table displaying the collums Train name, Destination, Frequency, Next arrival, and the minutes until that next arrival. These will remain pulled up until the firebase table is manually cleared. 

Down below, the user can enter information about a new train, and the table will be populated with the correctly calculated information once the user click the submit button.

### Future of this project
I would simply like to polish up the UI, and perhaps add a few more tables with more varying information.
